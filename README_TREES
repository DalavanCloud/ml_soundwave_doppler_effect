### Readme for the trees classifier in the gesture recognition application

The trees module implements the ensemble learning gradient boosting classifier based on decision trees.

### Configutation:
The following parameters can be set in config/personal.cfg to configure the classifiert
estimators          - (int) number of estimators
learning-rate       - (float) learning rate
max-depth           - max depth of decision tree
gestures            - gestures to train with comma separated, for insctance 1,2,3,4,5

### Usage:
start main application and use the following commands
u trees             - load tree classifier
t                   - training of the gradient boosting classifier with specified congig
c                   - start live classification
